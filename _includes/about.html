                <em>Update September, 2017</em>:
                <br> Hurricane Harvey has caused major flooding and devastation in East Texas,
                which will be recovering from the damage for years to come.
                In lieu of a wedding gift, we encourage you to consider
                a donation to one of the hurricane relief and rebuilding efforts:
                <br>
                <a href=https://ghcf.org/>Greater Houston Community Foundation</a>
                <br>
                <a href=https://www.rebuildtx.org/>Rebuild Texas Fund</a>
                <br>

                <br>
                If you prefer to give a traditional wedding gift, we still have a few items on a <a href=https://www.zola.com/registry/chugly>registry</a>.
