Georgetown is 23 miles north of downtown Austin, about 30 minute drive up I-35.  We are happy to facilitate carpools, and are looking into renting shuttles if there is enough interest.  

If you have an opinion on this, or would like to go car-free during your stay in Austin, give us a call.  We'd like to hear from you to make the event safe and fun for everyone!
